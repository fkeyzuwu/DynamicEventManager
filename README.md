# Dynamic Event Manager
 A simple event manager that lets you add and remove listener functions to event types, and invoke them.
 It also supports await calls so you can wait in between event execution if needed.
 Documentation is available inside the Godot engine inside the EventManager and Event class.
[b]note:[/b] The singleton name for interaction is [Events], but [EventManager] is the actual class_name so documentation could be generated. So when looking for the documentation, search for "EventManager".
